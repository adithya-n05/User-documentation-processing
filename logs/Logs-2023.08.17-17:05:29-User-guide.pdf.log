INFO:root:The process for making a single transfer involves three stages: Initiate Transfer, Review, and Complete. 

In the Initiate Transfer stage, a unique Payment Reference ID is generated automatically. This stage is where you enter the necessary details for the transfer.

In the Review stage, you can review the information entered and make any necessary changes before submitting the transfer request.

In the Complete stage, the transfer request is submitted for approval. Once approved, a confirmation message will be displayed.

Please note that this information is based on the provided context and may vary depending on the specific system or platform being used.
